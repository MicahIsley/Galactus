# Galactus

This website is a personal project of mine, but it showcases a fair number of different javascript libraries.

The main use for the website is the character page. On this page, each of the players can look at their current stats, keep track of their items, read their abilities, check their spells, and even write notes for later. This page uses a mix of dynamically generated content and hard coded information.

The spell list page is a simple search engine for players to pick out new spells to learn for their characters. Once the player has selected the spell they want, they simply click the "learn" button and now this spell will show in their main character page.

I use mySQL as the database to store all the neccessary information. I developed this website from conception through deployment.
