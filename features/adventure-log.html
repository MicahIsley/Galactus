							<h2>First Steps</h2>
									<p>Adventures do not always fall into our laps, and rarely are those the ones that you wish to remember. The most epic of adventures belong to those who seek them out, to those who eagerly jump into the thralls of their fate.</p>
									<p>Deep in the realm of Maktallen to the west of the Veil of Ethron, lies Gold Town, the capital of Argonia. This walled city contains a number of large industrial factories, a great deal of wealth held tightly by the upper class, and far too much poverty shared by everyone else. The spiraling smoke rising from the largest stone tavern just past Market Square within Gold Town is where our story begins.</p>
									<p>The tavern attracts a wide variety of different creatures who come in to have some ale and rest after a long day at the market. This tavern also has a reputation for being the place to go should you be in need of hiring or being hired for special missions. On this peaceful evening, a blond haired, blue eyed farm girl stands up before the tavern patrons and explains the ghastly plight of her town, Fendallen. She shares how her small farming village has been having visits from the undead and, though no one has yet been harmed, they are quite shaken and fear for their lives. She insists that they will give as much as they can to compensate any who will fight off these zombies. Whether their motives be for glory, for pride, for revenge, or to prove themselves, a hodgepodge of heroes decide to accept the desperate mission set before them by this bold farm girl.</p>
									<p>The following brave souls raise their arms and agree to meet Annabelle in Fendallen: Fannar Imada the elf cleric, Regina the Wretched the teifling warlock, Alea Vonbella the dark elf ranger, Fenla Arila the forest gnome druid, Synndur the Sober the dragonborn sorcerer, Scepter de Scepter the human bard, Clithsbee the dwarf barbarian, and Mini Me the halfling rogue.</p>	
									<p>Clithsbee, being a rather old and senile dwarf, waves his hand in farewell to his companions and sets off alone for Fendallen. After exploring Gold Town to barter for supplies and engage in some misguided fortune telling, the rest of the adventurers make their way to Fendallen without a hitch. (Although Mini Me did not set the best first impression in Gold Town as he haggled unreasonably and threatened the merchants, he still remained a member of the party as they entered the small farming village.)</p>
									<p>It seems that fate is not playing kindly with the adventurers as they interview townsfolk, search for magical influences, and anticipate the coming of night when the undead are likely to make an appearance. They have all of the right intentions, but do not manage to make very much headway.</p>
									<p>The heroes begin to reveal their unique characteristics as they seek the truth for why the undead have suddenly begun to torment Fendallen. Synndur and Regina have set themselves apart in their aggression and mistrust toward the people in this town. They suspect treachery and are quick to believe that everyone is bent on deceit. Alea and Scepter have a quiet demeanor which, alongside Fannar’s perceptive nature, allows for a more rational decision making process. Fenla and Clithsbee are more brash than the others and boldly follow their instincts, sometimes into dangerous situations.</p>
									<p>Around twilight, they decide to head over and closely analyze the local graveyard to see if the undead were residents of Fendallen. As the others are poking around, Regina discovers a dark, magical presence surrounding the gravestones. However, the party does not seem to be functioning at their highest capacity and can discover little beyond that. They decide to simply head back into town and sleep for the night. Alea and Fenla take the first watch and the others settle down in the middle of the town square to rest.</p>
									<p>As the hours pass, Alea and Fenla begin to feel uneasy. Alea, with her superior dark vision, is the first to notice the ungainly figures limping and dragging themselves toward them. Although they quickly jump up to awaken the others, Alea and Fenla take immediate action against the zombies. Fenla brazenly attempts a wild climb up a building near the closest zombie, but fails and scrabbles her way slowly back to the ground between two of these walking corpses. Alea aims true and shoots an arrow at the one closest to Fenla, but it misses its mark and only grazes him.</p>
									<p>This is the first battle that these heroes are undertaking together, and it does not seem to be going very smoothly. Fannar does save Fenla’s life by jumping into the throws of her battle and pulling her to safety, but most of the attention turns to the zombies that have congregated around Clithsbee. You see, Clithsbee rushed up and swung his war hammer with all mighty intentions, but must have been distracted for he completely missed his target. Such was the force of his intended blow that he spun around and ended up flat on his back - extremely vulnerable to the onslaught of the zombies.</p>
									<p>Magical fires soar, arrows whiz, swords fall, and at last the undead appear to be dead once more. They all take a deep breath and begin to sheath their weapons when Alea suddenly bolts upright and points into the darkness by one of the shops. Her dark vision allowed her to notice the flash of a dark figure sprinting from the scene of the battle and out of the town square. Fannar is not eager to sprint off into the darkness unprepared, but the will of the rest of the party wins out and they take off in pursuit.</p>
									<p>They are managing to keep the figure in sight and find themselves dashing across the graveyard that they had visited earlier in the day. It is now around 2 in the morning and they observe runes on the gravestones that they had not noticed before. They pass these as they continue their chase through the hay fields. Then, they come across a sight that they could not ignore. A clearing has been made in this field and a number of piles of animal bones are scattered throughout it. Dark magic is evident here and there are signs of recent spells being cast. Although this discovery is very startling, they unfortunately took too long in their exploration of it and have lost sight of the dark figure. Mini Me, rather foolheartedly, decides to stay behind and camp out in the graveyard in case the figure returns.</p>
									<p>The adventurers have taken injuries and do not at all feel the heroes that the town makes them out to be, so they pick up their gear and rest for what little is left of the night.</p>
									<p>With the call of the rooster they rise and set out through the town to find Annabelle and see if they can uncover the answer as to why those despicable creatures came to town last night. Annabelle is busy at her chores and promises to talk with them when she is available. Since her mother is at home, they speak with her instead. They quickly notice her underlying fear behind her gratefulness. Something is still not right here.</p>
									<p>The mother departs to fulfill her own duties of the day and the adventurers decide to hang back and snoop around the house. The house is not very large, so they leave half of the company outside to keep watch. They soon make their way to Annabelle’s room. Did the floor creak oddly when they stepped upon the rug in the center of the room? They peel it away to reveal the boards beneath, but it just looks like an ordinary wood floor. Regina and Scepter check for a magical presence, and are stunned by the strength of the one they feel just beneath their feet.</p>
									<p>As Scepter, Regina, and Fenla discuss how to proceed, a loud moan followed by a jarring crash takes place behind them. They whip around and behold, Clithsbee had taken it upon himself and smashed a hole in the middle of the floor with his war hammer. The shock of the moment wears off and they all peer down in the hole and see only a deep, dark, vertical tunnel that went way farther into the earth than a normal home’s foundation. Fenla drops a ball of fire down into it, but it just seems to continue to fall until it is out of sight. </p>
									<p>Fenla then volunteers to be lowered down into the hole, since she is the lightest of the group. She lights her faerie fire, ties the rope around her waist, and drops down into the hole. They watch her drop deeper and deeper down until at last she hits solid ground. Before her is a hallway that leads to a room that is empty except for glowing runes arranged in a blue circle on the floor. Fenla calls up to Regina and Scepter, who quickly join her in the hole and get to work analyzing the magical symbols.</p>
									<p>Back up on watch duty, Synndur, Alea, and Fannar see that Annabelle has finished her chores and is coming back into the house. Although they try their best to be deceptive and keep her outside, they only succeed in raising her suspicions and causing her to quickly duck into the house to see what is going on. Synndur locks her arms behind her back as the party upstairs questions her about the hole in her room. Annabelle is genuinely shocked at what has been hidden beneath her floorboards and is terribly offended that she is being questioned so severely. Finally, they decide to lower her into the hole to confront her face to face about the runes.</p>
									<p>Scepter angrily confronts her and tries to bully her into admitting that she must have at least known that this entire room existed just beneath where she has been sleeping her whole life. At last, Annabelle shows her true colors. She stands up a little straighter and sheds the innocent farm girl smile that had been painted on her face. Her hair turns black, as do her eyes, as she coldly smiles around the room. This has all been a fun experiment that she been conducting on this town, and she is amused at how long it took for them to discover her. Hoping to stun her, Fenla spryly flicks out her blow gun and shoots a poison dart at her neck. The doppelganger catches the dart and casts a wicked glance about the room before sprinting into the center of the glowing rune circle and vanishing from sight.</p>
									<p>When the adventurers divulge what took place to Annabelle’s parents, they admit that she has not been herself these past few weeks after disappearing into the woods and reappearing days later with the simple excuse of having been lost. They now fear that their Annabelle was taken captive at that time or, perhaps, murdered.</p>
									<p>This is the end of the first adventure that this company has experienced together, but their story has barely even begun.</p>
