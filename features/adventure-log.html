							<h2>A Date With The Undead</h2>
								<p id="italics">Adventures do not always fall into our laps, and rarely are those the ones that you wish to remember. The most epic of adventures belong to those who seek them out, to those who eagerly jump into the thralls of their fate.</p>
								<p>Deep in the realm of Maktallen to the west of the Veil of Ethron, lies Gold Town, the capital of Argonia. This walled city contains a number of large industrial factories, a great deal of wealth held tightly by the upper class, and far too much poverty shared by everyone else. The spiraling smoke rising from the largest stone tavern just past Market Square within Gold Town is where our story begins.</p>
								<p>The tavern attracts a wide variety of different creatures who come in to have some ale and rest after a long day at the market. This tavern also has a reputation for being the place to go should you be in need of hiring or being hired for special missions. On this peaceful evening, a blond haired, blue eyed farm girl stands up before the tavern patrons and explains the ghastly plight of her town, Fendallen. She shares how her small farming village has been having visits from the undead and, though no one has yet been harmed, they are quite shaken and fear for their lives. She insists that they will give as much as they can to compensate any who will fight off these zombies. Whether their motives be for glory, for pride, for revenge, or to prove themselves, a hodgepodge of heroes decide to accept the desperate mission set before them by this bold farm girl.</p>
								<p>The following brave souls raise their arms and agree to meet Annabelle in Fendallen: Fannar Imada the elf cleric, Regina the Wretched the teifling warlock, Alea Vonbella the dark elf ranger, Fenla Arila the forest gnome druid, Synndur the Sober the dragonborn sorcerer, Scepter de Scepter the human bard, Clithsbee the dwarf barbarian, and Mini Me the halfling rogue.</p>	
								<p>Clithsbee, being a rather old and senile dwarf, waves his hand in farewell to his companions and sets off alone for Fendallen. After exploring Gold Town to barter for supplies and engage in some misguided fortune telling, the rest of the adventurers make their way to Fendallen without a hitch. (Although Mini Me did not set the best first impression in Gold Town as he haggled unreasonably and threatened the merchants, he still remained a member of the party as they entered the small farming village.)</p>
								<p>It seems that fate is not playing kindly with the adventurers as they interview townsfolk, search for magical influences, and anticipate the coming of night when the undead are likely to make an appearance. They have all of the right intentions, but do not manage to make very much headway.</p>
								<p>The heroes begin to reveal their unique characteristics as they seek the truth for why the undead have suddenly begun to torment Fendallen. Synndur and Regina have set themselves apart in their aggression and mistrust toward the people in this town. They suspect treachery and are quick to believe that everyone is bent on deceit. Alea and Scepter have a quiet demeanor which, alongside Fannar’s perceptive nature, allows for a more rational decision making process. Fenla and Clithsbee are more brash than the others and boldly follow their instincts, sometimes into dangerous situations.</p>
								<p>Around twilight, they decide to head over and closely analyze the local graveyard to see if the undead were residents of Fendallen. As the others are poking around, Regina discovers a dark, magical presence surrounding the gravestones. However, the party does not seem to be functioning at their highest capacity and can discover little beyond that. They decide to simply head back into town and sleep for the night. Alea and Fenla take the first watch and the others settle down in the middle of the town square to rest.</p>
								<p>As the hours pass, Alea and Fenla begin to feel uneasy. Alea, with her superior dark vision, is the first to notice the ungainly figures limping and dragging themselves toward them. Although they quickly jump up to awaken the others, Alea and Fenla take immediate action against the zombies. Fenla brazenly attempts a wild climb up a building near the closest zombie, but fails and scrabbles her way slowly back to the ground between two of these walking corpses. Alea aims true and shoots an arrow at the one closest to Fenla, but it misses its mark and only grazes him.</p>
								<p>This is the first battle that these heroes are undertaking together, and it does not seem to be going very smoothly. Fannar does save Fenla’s life by jumping into the throws of her battle and pulling her to safety, but most of the attention turns to the zombies that have congregated around Clithsbee. You see, Clithsbee rushed up and swung his war hammer with all mighty intentions, but must have been distracted for he completely missed his target. Such was the force of his intended blow that he spun around and ended up flat on his back - extremely vulnerable to the onslaught of the zombies.</p>
								<p>Magical fires soar, arrows whiz, swords fall, and at last the undead appear to be dead once more. They all take a deep breath and begin to sheath their weapons when Alea suddenly bolts upright and points into the darkness by one of the shops. Her dark vision allowed her to notice the flash of a dark figure sprinting from the scene of the battle and out of the town square. Fannar is not eager to sprint off into the darkness unprepared, but the will of the rest of the party wins out and they take off in pursuit.</p>
								<p>They are managing to keep the figure in sight and find themselves dashing across the graveyard that they had visited earlier in the day. It is now around 2 in the morning and they observe runes on the gravestones that they had not noticed before. They pass these as they continue their chase through the hay fields. Then, they come across a sight that they could not ignore. A clearing has been made in this field and a number of piles of animal bones are scattered throughout it. Dark magic is evident here and there are signs of recent spells being cast. Although this discovery is very startling, they unfortunately took too long in their exploration of it and have lost sight of the dark figure. Mini Me, rather foolheartedly, decides to stay behind and camp out in the graveyard in case the figure returns.</p>
								<p>The adventurers have taken injuries and do not at all feel the heroes that the town makes them out to be, so they pick up their gear and rest for what little is left of the night.</p>
								<p>With the call of the rooster they rise and set out through the town to find Annabelle and see if they can uncover the answer as to why those despicable creatures came to town last night. Annabelle is busy at her chores and promises to talk with them when she is available. Since her mother is at home, they speak with her instead. They quickly notice her underlying fear behind her gratefulness. Something is still not right here.</p>
								<p>The mother departs to fulfill her own duties of the day and the adventurers decide to hang back and snoop around the house. The house is not very large, so they leave half of the company outside to keep watch. They soon make their way to Annabelle’s room. Did the floor creak oddly when they stepped upon the rug in the center of the room? They peel it away to reveal the boards beneath, but it just looks like an ordinary wood floor. Regina and Scepter check for a magical presence, and are stunned by the strength of the one they feel just beneath their feet.</p>
								<p>As Scepter, Regina, and Fenla discuss how to proceed, a loud moan followed by a jarring crash takes place behind them. They whip around and behold, Clithsbee had taken it upon himself and smashed a hole in the middle of the floor with his war hammer. The shock of the moment wears off and they all peer down in the hole and see only a deep, dark, vertical tunnel that went way farther into the earth than a normal home’s foundation. Fenla drops a ball of fire down into it, but it just seems to continue to fall until it is out of sight. </p>
								<p>Fenla then volunteers to be lowered down into the hole, since she is the lightest of the group. She lights her faerie fire, ties the rope around her waist, and drops down into the hole. They watch her drop deeper and deeper down until at last she hits solid ground. Before her is a hallway that leads to a room that is empty except for glowing runes arranged in a blue circle on the floor. Fenla calls up to Regina and Scepter, who quickly join her in the hole and get to work analyzing the magical symbols.</p>
								<p>Back up on watch duty, Synndur, Alea, and Fannar see that Annabelle has finished her chores and is coming back into the house. Although they try their best to be deceptive and keep her outside, they only succeed in raising her suspicions and causing her to quickly duck into the house to see what is going on. Synndur locks her arms behind her back as the party upstairs questions her about the hole in her room. Annabelle is genuinely shocked at what has been hidden beneath her floorboards and is terribly offended that she is being questioned so severely. Finally, they decide to lower her into the hole to confront her face to face about the runes.</p>
								<p>Scepter angrily confronts her and tries to bully her into admitting that she must have at least known that this entire room existed just beneath where she has been sleeping her whole life. At last, Annabelle shows her true colors. She stands up a little straighter and sheds the innocent farm girl smile that had been painted on her face. Her hair turns black, as do her eyes, as she coldly smiles around the room. This has all been a fun experiment that she been conducting on this town, and she is amused at how long it took for them to discover her. Hoping to stun her, Fenla spryly flicks out her blow gun and shoots a poison dart at her neck. The doppelganger catches the dart and casts a wicked glance about the room before sprinting into the center of the glowing rune circle and vanishing from sight.</p>
								<p>When the adventurers divulge what took place to Annabelle’s parents, they admit that she has not been herself these past few weeks after disappearing into the woods and reappearing days later with the simple excuse of having been lost. They now fear that their Annabelle was taken captive at that time or, perhaps, murdered.</p>
								<p>This is the end of the first adventure that this company has experienced together, but their story has barely even begun.</p>

							<h2>Darkness and Mystery</h2>
								<p id="italics">The richest of treasure awaits those willing to dig the deepest. At least, that is how the saying goes. What is not acknowledged in this saying is that those willing to dig the deepest must also pay the price for their intrepidity.</p>
								<p>Following the dramatic events that unfolded in Fendallen, our heroes were feeling rather disheartened. They defeated their foes in the zombie attack of town square only to discover that it was all a ploy set in motion by the one who brought them together in the first place. The deep black hair and eyes of the woman pretending to be the farm girl, Annabelle, reminded Fenla of an unlikely friend that she had made years ago in the Veil of Ethron. She confided in her companions that this woman is undoubtedly one of the wicked Bloodfist family who rule in the realm beyond her forest. What had she meant by conducting an experiment? Was she testing her zombies? Or, was she testing them? After much discussion, they bittersweetly went their separate ways.</p>
								<p>About a month has passed when they all find themselves together in a tavern once more. Each had received a letter from Reginald Gershalt, the Lord of Goldtown, imploring them to make haste to his manor. Having heard of their exploits in Fedallen, he desired to hire their services in order to deal with an unfortunate event that has taken place at one of his holdings. His words were vague and yet flattering, and consequently all of the adventurers seem to have answered his summons.</p>
								<p>Synndur, having perhaps tilted his tankard a few too many times, roams about the tavern interrogating the people for information about the Lord of Goldtown. He simply learns that Reginald Gershalt is an extremely wealthy man with little time for the peasants who patronize this tavern.</p>
								<p>Around midday they leave the tavern and head to the noble district of Gold Town. As they pass by increasingly impressive mansions and fancy buildings on the way to Gershalt’s manor, their heads become inflated with the realization that success in this mission will mean a handsome reward indeed. At last, they arrive at their destination: an enormous white mansion surrounded by a large fence and guards looking like an army of ants surrounding the whole estate.</p>
								<p>Scepter is about to knock upon the door when it sweeps open to reveal a stocky servant. He quickly glances them over and leads them into the enormous parlor graced by an elegant, crystal chandelier. They wait a handful of breaths before they are taken in to meet their benefactor.</p>
								<p>Reginald Gershalt is just as pompous as they expected him to be. He hastily informs them of the disastrous events unfolding in the Gershalt Mine. His foreman, Kurdvar, appears to have lost his mind and is running amok with a gang of goblins throughout the mine. There have been casualties and he simply wants the matter dealt with. Gershalt has little patience for the company’s questions beyond this and quickly sends them out of his presence with a purse for supplies.</p>
								<p>The Dragon’s Hoard is their next stop as they stock up on supplies and select fancy new weapons. Alea, Regina, and Fenla decide to stop in the local coffee shop while the boys finish bartering for wares. These three are enjoying their hot beverages when a hooded man enters and seats himself at their table. Fannar walks in just as the newcomer removes his hood to reveal himself.</p>
								<p>He introduces himself as Franco Bufandi, a half elf from the slums of Goldtown. He shamelessly admits to having been following them for some time now and beseeches them to heed his words. Franco has sworn his life to the lives of those that live beneath the foot of the wealthy here in Goldtown. The rich and the arrogant have been in charge for far too long and Gershalt, he confides, is the worst of them all. He asks to join their party and for them to take part in his mission to take down Gershalt and those like him. He has just completed his dramatic speech when, suddenly, Fenla accidently reverts to her wolf form and gets them all kicked out of the coffee shop.</p>
								<p>By this point, the rest of the group has congregated outside and, together, they decide to allow Franco to join them - though they are unsure that they will act on his convictions. Now the party consists of 8 members: Fannar Imada, Regina the Wretched, Alea Vonbella, Fenla Arila, Synndur the Sober, Scepter de Scepter, Clithsbee, and Franco Bufandi. The last that we heard of Mini Me is that he was camping out at the graveyard in Fendallen awaiting the return of the dark figure. Perhaps that is where he remains?</p>
								<p>Finally, the party arrives at the Gershalt Mine. They are greeted by a portly dwarf who gives them a brief tour of the upper portion of the cavern, where miners are still busy at work. As the adventurers take note of the obvious signs of a recent goblin battle here on the surface, Franco seizes the opportunity to slip away. He uses his impressive stealth to enter a forbidden door where he finds a plethora of boxes that he is sure contain dynamite. Perhaps smoke got in his eyes, perhaps he was feeling the need to rush in case someone caught him, or perhaps he cannot read... For whatever reason, Franco grabs a few objects at random and jams them in his pockets.</p>
								<p>By the time the dwarf shows them the elevator that will take them down into the mine where the foreman is believed to be, Franco seamlessly returns the party. The elevator doors clang shut and the mechanism makes horrible, metallic groans as it travels deeper and deeper into the mine. They begin to fear that they should not have combined all their weight on the elevator at the same time when it finally shutters to a halt.</p>
								<p>The doors creak open only to reveal pitch black in all directions. Fortunately, a number of the party have dark vision and Fenla is kind enough to produce a flame in her hand so that the rest can see as well. There are two different paths that they can take. They choose the one on the right and run down it until they come to a solid wall. They are about to turnabout to go down the other way when they hear cling clang cling clang cling clang. The others have just enough time to dive out of the way as Clithsbee sprints toward them and swings his war hammer at the wall. To their surprise, it crumbles and they can peek through to see that the path continues ahead of them. They clear the rocks away and follow this path to a wide open room filled with stalagmites and stalactites that cast bizarre shadows from the glowing blue light beyond them. With some trepidation, the gang begins to utilize their stealth as they proceed toward the blue light.</p>
								<p>This room is larger than they had anticipated. They proceed silently into the room until they come to about the center of it where the path opens up and reveals a suspiciously exposed pile of treasure. After a brief whispered discussion, the group agrees to leave the potentially dangerous treasure untouched lest they disturb a dark force deep down in the mine. However, not everyone is eager to honor this decision. Unbeknownst to his companions, Fannar quickly slips a large, red gem into his jerken.</p>
								<p>No immediate consequences seem to take place as they move forward, quiet as mice. A door is visible at the far end of the cavern with steep steps leading upward and the eerie blue light illuminates the ceiling high above their heads. The path that they are following has steep drop offs on either side of them with streams of water at their bottoms. A loud outcry from the back of the group abruptly set them all to sprinting toward the staircase. The water, rising rapidly from the caverns, has gruesome skeletons floating in it and ascends above the adventurers heads before they reach the staircase.</p>
								<p>They do not all make it up. Although they manage to rescue most of the ones who failed the climb up the stairs, Alea is drifting away from them. Panicked, Fannar tosses a rope at Clithsbee and immediately dives into the water after her. Clithsbee holds fast to the rope as Fannar wades through death and water to reach the struggling Alea. He wraps the rope around her and tightly grips it as Clithsbee and a number of the group help to pull them to safety.</p>
								<p>They recover themselves and dry off before entering a new room at the top of the stairs. This room is lined with stones and gargoyles along either wall. At the far end lies some sort of altar with what appears to be an enormous chest resting in the middle of it. It all looks too easy. Regina quiets the nervous murmurings of the party as she bravely marches ahead. A swishing sound is heard and a poison dart flies into Regina’s shoulder. She clearly set off a trip wire. She stumbles back to where the rest of them were waiting as they debate what to attempt next.</p>
								<p>In the end, Alea ties a rope to one of her arrows and shoots it into the wall above the altar. Fenla, being the smallest, offers to climb the rope in the hopes of avoiding any other trip wires. She shimmies her way across this enormous room and makes it about halfway to the altar without incident. Fenla lets out a pent up breath just as two large gargoyles scrape the floor as they turn to face her.</p>
								<p>Bedlam ensues. Fenla turns into a wolf in order to incite speed in the retreat from her predicament and escapes with only one stone smack from a gargoyle. It is difficult to recall the chaos of a battle, even a battle won. Arrows and physical force do not seem to have much effect on the two stone adversaries. Magic, on the other hand, proves a formidable defense. Regina and Synndur take the lead in this battle. After much spell casting and dark incantations, Synndur soundly annihilates the gargoyles in a shock of light and fire.</p>
								<p>The battle finished, the adventurers finally make their way to the altar. They hesitate for but a moment before opening the chest. To their delight, they discover a number of amazing relics and treasures within! They divide them among themselves and are about to leave when they notice that the wall behind the altar has a strange orange tint to it. Upon closer examination, they are startled by the fact that the outline of a person is visible deep within this amber-like substance.</p>
								<p>Once again, Clithsbee provides no warning as he uses his war hammer to smash into the amber and send the body tumbling out onto the floor. It is a small man sprawled on the ground before them. He does not show any signs of life, but Fenla is unwilling to leave him without at least trying to save him. She performs a healing charm and, after a few moments, the man begins to stir.</p>
								<p>It does not take him long to hop to his feet and announce his name to be Maximus the Magnificent, a mighty halfling explorer bent on discovering the world’s most sought after treasures. Alas, he did not fare so well in this mine and cannot recall how long it has been since he was entombed within the amber. They presume it has been quite a long time. This boisterous fellow asks to join the party as they continue their adventure, and they accept thinking him daft enough to not be a danger to them.</p>
								<p>Not one of them has forgotten their mission. With treasure and a new member in tow, they venture back to where the paths break and choose the left tunnel to continue their search for the foreman, Kurdvar. This new direction leads them to another large room. Despite their use of stealth, their presence does not go unnoticed.</p>
								<p>Let us hope that the battle that commences foreshadows how our adventurers will perform in their future endeavors. This battle truly marks a turning point for them as they bring forth their strengths and flow alongside one another to defeat their enemies. These enemies are goblins and, to their relief and chagrin, Kurdvar. The foreman has no life behind his eyes and his whole body appears to be emitting a dark smoke.</p>
								<p>They are greatly aided by the combined effects of faerie fire, which makes each goblin an easy target, and the gem of brightness, which inflicts their enemies with blindness. The goblins fall, and the only creature that remains is Kurdvar - or the cadaver that once was the foreman of the mine. They surround and defeat him handily. The real challenge is to take him down without taking his life. Scepter aims to knock him out but, sadly, misses and Kurvar moves no more. The reason that Kurdvar has been behaving so strangely now becomes evident, for from within his body emerges a shadow demon.</p>
								<p>The name of this monstrosity does not do it justice. It is truly terrifying especially here, miles beneath the surface and from escape. They have no choice, they must fight it. How do you keep your eyes on a shifting shadow? Yet, this shadow is not without form. The demon stands at least 8 feet above Regina, the tallest of the party. Its horns stand upon its head and curve back along its elongated spine. With shredded paper wings as black as its body it rears up and utilizes both dark magic and physical force to attack. A shockingly brief battle takes place and the adventurers amaze themselves by vanquishing this menacing foe without taking a single injury. It is time for them to leave this dreary place and claim their rightful reward from Gershalt.</p>
								<p>They make their way back up the elevator, quickly excuse themselves from the godforsaken mine, and return to the noble district. Their movements becomes increasingly wary as they notice some changes that have taken place while they were in the mine. The atmosphere is charged with something they cannot identify and the Gershalt Manor, to their horror, has no guards in sight. Their hopes of a grand welcome and an ample reward begin to dwindle as Synndur leads the party into the abandoned mansion.</p>
								<p>Apparently not abandoned, they soon realize! Standing by the grand stairs is a tall, cloaked figure who turns slowly to their approach. Who are you and what has happened here, they demand to know. The cloaked figure turns briefly to inspect them through his spectacles then refuses to answer any questions and begins to depart hastily toward the back door. Clithsbee, never one to give up easily, lands a neat punch straight to the figure’s face. He falls heavily to the floor and his glasses clatter to the ground beside him.</p>
								<p>Bright yellow eyes with reptilian-like slits down their middles look up at them in anger from the floor. They interrogate this strange man and discover that Gershalt owed a great debt and that it has finally been collected. Gershalt will not be seen here again, of that they can be quite certain. Disgruntled, the man responds in an impatient and withholding manner. The party is getting very worked up and beginning to argue among themselves when another figure appears in the doorway. They all turn to see the mysterious newcomer and their hearts drop as they take in his dark hair and black eyes. “It is time we talk,” he says...</p>
						</div>
						<div class="chapterText" id="chapterThreeContent">
							<h2>Chasing their tails into the lair of the snakes. </h2>
								<p>In real life, sometimes we miss things. We let pass us by the people that we need the most and we circumvent glorious opportunities - even when they lay directly before us. This adventure, my friends, felt much like this for quite some time. Fannar, Regina, Fenla, and Maximus take a frustratingly windy path and hit many a bump in the road before they finally scrape the surface of the mystery that they are trying to unfold. But scrape they did, and perhaps they have already stuck their hands in too deeply to a hole that they cannot escape.</p>
								<p>It begins where we left off: in the mansion of Lord Gershalt of Gold Town. Only the 4 previously mentioned adventurers remain at this point (for reasons that will hopefully be explainable in the future) and they are enraged to find that Gershalt is not, in fact, going to be paying them what they are due for their heroic acts in his mine. Fenla quickly casts a charm spell on the mysterious snake-eyed man so that they can focus on the equally mysterious black-eyed stranger who has entered with the announcement that they must “talk.”</p>
								<p>This dark stranger turns out to be none other than Moro Bloodfist of the Bloodfist Castle. The only interaction that most of the group has had with a Bloodfist was with the imposter pretending to be Annabelle, so their hackles immediately stand up. Fenla, who is actually a good friend of Moro, reassures them that he can be trusted. Moro proceeds to inform them that the individual who impersonated Annabelle is his wicked sister, Malise Bloodfist, and he has been searching for her for quite a while. Something dark is happening beyond their imagining and Moro is positive that Malise is behind it.</p>
								<p>After some catching up and a sharing of information, Moro departs to pursue further leads on his sister’s whereabouts. Fannar, Regina, Fenla, and Maximus are unable to glean much from the snake-eyed man except that his name is Talash and that he is here in the mansion searching for a secret vault because Gershalt has been “taken care of.” Fannar’s ears perk up at the thought of a hidden vault filled with treasure, and he quickly persuades the rest of them to forget about Gershalt for a while and help him find it.</p>
								<p>No sooner do they begin to leave the parlor than Talash shows signs of shaking off the charm and darts quickly out the door and down the street. Regina spritely follows him and Fannar cuts him off and tackles him to the ground. Winded and confused, he looks up at his pursuers and asks them what more they want with him, for he cannot tell them anything further. Stumped, they decide that they have no further use of him and let him go. They would later find out that this was a huge mistake...</p>
								<p>Back in the mansion, their searching leads them not to a vault, but rather to yet another unexpected stranger. Regina spots a Tabaxi lurking in an upstairs room of the manor! This large, calico tabby cat asserts that she is the housekeeper of this fine abode and reacts quite affronted by the way Regina drags her back to the parlor to answer to the rest of the group.</p>
								<p>Lying. Definitely lying. But she seems harmless enough. Her name is Autumn and she seems to genuinely want no trouble, so they let her be as they turn their attention back to the problem at hand. They cannot find this vault, Talash gave them no information to go by, and it doesn’t look like they are going to be getting their big pay day after all.</p>
								<p>It would be painful to recount the aimless wanderings and meaningless paths that these adventurers followed to finally get to the incredible place where they leave off. Instead, I will share three noteworthy events.</p>
								<p>The first event is a startling and rather graphic reunion with an old friend: Mini Me. As the gang is wandering down one of the streets in Gold Town fruitlessly looking for a lead, Mini Me bumps into Maximus in the road. Although Maximus profusely apologizes for the collision, Mini Me stabs him hard right in the chest. The city guard chases Mini Me away as the group comes to the realization that it was their old companion who just stabbed their friend and took off. Baffled, they quickly use their healing potion on Maximus and take him to the tavern for some food. It is later at this tavern that Mini Me materializes again and explains to a very terrified Maximus that he was drugged… or something… and he is very sorry. And in this way he rejoins the group. Now we have six adventurers.</p>
								<p>The second event is extremely embarrassing. The adventurers decide to check in on the new lord of Goldtown to see if that helps to point them in the right direction. They manage to find his residence and skillfully convince the guards that they are “special” workers. The guards completely fall for it and lead them directly to Lord Sigmund Finskoft. Feeling well pleased with themselves, they look Lord Finskoft in the face only to realize that they have no idea what to ask him. All the work to gain access to precisely where they are standing, and they choke; leaving without a single bit of helpful information.</p>
								<p>The third event is the pivotal one that leads them to the nest of snakes - literally. They make their way to the leader of the black market and pay him to tell them where they could find a certain emblem that they had discovered in a book within the Gershalt library. They hide out along the alleyway where an exchange is to take place. Low and behold ,Talash makes a reappearance as a conspirator in the selling of such an item on the black market. Long story short, there is a fight, a chase, and a stealthy pursuit down a sewer grate. At last, our adventurers feel themselves sidle their way back on track.</p> 
								<p>Regina conjures a snake to follow Talash into this sewer. Fannar and Autumn, the stealthiest of the six, also continue the chase into the sewer while the others follow along on the road above. After a short time, Talash unknowingly leads them to a secret meeting of what appear to be snake worshippers in a room leading off to the left from the tunnel that they were following. Fannar is playing scenario after scenario in his head and Regina is recounting what she sees through the eyes of the snake for her friends above. Autumn takes matters into her own hands.</p>
								<p>With a confident strut she makes her way into the room and tries to blend right in with the rest of the worshippers. She seems to be getting away with it too. Autumn manages to eavesdrop to the point of discovering that these crazy snake people are involved in human trafficking when suddenly Talash stands up before his followers and announces that a pretender has entered their midst. He points at Autumn and declares that the one who kills this giant cat will be honored beyond their dreams. They begin to chant “kill, kill, kill.” At first, Autumn is still hopeful that she can get away with her facade as she also chants “kill, kill, kill” and looks behind her as if this is about someone else. The crowd is clearly not convinced, and at last Autumn drops her gambit and splits.</p>
								<p>Fannar is standing in the T of the tunnel where the room intersects and casts a powerful wind spell just as Autumn passes him. This spell lifts the whole crowd of fanatics off their feet and blasts them back down the opposite tunnel. Fannar and Autumn sprint back the way they came - up the ladder safely out of the sewer and into the welcoming company of the rest of the group.</p>
								<p>The adventurers wait until the fall of night and once more locate this band of snake worshippers. Upon following them through the sewer maze, they emerge and sneakily chase them as they travel through the outskirts of town. At last, they behold a swampy landscape stretching out before them. They pursue their prey to a pyramid-shaped temple where they spend a great deal of time in stealthy investigation with Fenla in the form of a rat and Regina’s snake prowling about.</p>
								<p>At long last, the real action begins! They all enter the temple together and fight a number of enemies ranging from mostly human to mostly snakelike. They proceed up multiple flights of stairs until we come to yet another snake monster who did not take kindly to the entrance of a spoon into his lair as a supposed safety measure. This battle is bloody, but Fannar clinches the win with an uppercut slice straight through the serpentine head.</p>
								<p>And in this hazardous location inside the lair of snakes, our episode ends.

								<h2>The dangers continue and closure feels imminent, but it is not to be had today.</h2>
								<p>This is to be the shortests of our adventures so far. We begin again within the temple of the snakes where the group continues to search for any sign of the people that they believe are in mortal danger. Autumn sneaks along a dark hallway as the others pilfer the room in which they slayed the latest snake monster. With a foreboding feeling, Autumn finds herself gazing into small, empty prison cells as he makes his way down the narrow hallway.</p>
								<p>He gets to the end and realizes that one of the prison cells is not empty. A beat up, dishevelled, and crazy-eyed man is huddled in the corner of the last cell. He immediately shoots up and grabs the bars when he sees the giant cat, begging this stranger to take pity on him and help him escape. He has been tortured for information and is worried that he will not be able to hold out much longer. With an understanding nod and a smile, Autumn slowly backs away and slinks back to the rest of the group.</p>
								<p>Fannar searches the body of the snake monster and, fortunately, finds a big set of keys. He pockets them and joins the adventurers as they all make their way back to the prisoner. This prisoner is none other than Reginald Gershalt! After a heated argument over their payment, Gershalt assures them that, should they free him from this cell and bring him to safety, they will all receive their due reward. They accept and unlock his cell, but they stipulate that they will first finish their investigation and rescue the other prisoners.</p>
								<p>There certainly were others, far less fortunate others who had already been dragged from their cells. For most of these souls, they were too late. Up on the rooftop of this cursed temple, the adventurers successfully sneak up on the leaders of the snake people and overhear a secret conversation that sets their blood to burning. The people are being used as human sacrifices to awaken an even more terrible beast!</p>
								<p>They could not contain themselves and burst onto the scene with weapons and spells at the ready. Autumn sings a demoralizing song that slightly brings down the snake worshippers as the onslaught commences. A surprisingly skillful battle takes place here on the rooftop with Fannar casting mighty spells, Fenla gorily mutilating in her wolf form, Regina surging forth her dark magic, and both Maximus and Autumn greatly aiding with their amazing healing attributes. They manage to wipe out the nastiest of the snake monsters and the leader when, suddenly, the earth begins to shake.</p>
								<p>Or that is what is seemed was happening. The beast that the snake people were trying to awaken was rising from his altar. The group is on their last legs and feeling the weight of all that they had already done this day as they turn to face this new enemy. FASHEW FASHEW. Two gleaming arrows arc over their heads and penetrate deep into the body of the beast. They have no time to search for their sudden allies, but rather raise their weapons and charge at the beast with all that they have left.</p>
								<p>Dead at last. Fannar lets out a whoop of delight as he peers over the temple wall and sees Alea waving from down below with a bow in her fist and Moro Bloodfist at her side. The temple conquered and reunited with their dear friends, things are looking up for the burgeoning band of adventurers.</p>

						<h2>From serpents to humans, the line of deception grows ever dim.</h2>
						<p>Atop the temple of snakes with enemies defeated, the gang feeds the prisoners and spends a day searching for spoils. These spoils include a fancy new staff for Fenla that can only be used by a druid and can turn into a serpent! Fannar, Alea, Fenla, Autumn, Moro, and good old Humphrey gain the allegiance of Reginald Gershalt for their acts of heroism and service to the recently demoted lord of Goldtown. Moro urges the group to continue searching for evidence of his sister’s plans, to which they agree to so long as it involves seeking out the elusive vault they keep hearing so much about.</p>
						<p>After safely making their way back to Goldtown, the ravaged prisoners were permitted to return to their homes. The adventurers decide to escort Gershalt back to his mansion and do some research in the library regarding the Gershalt vault, of which he recalls very little useful information from his childhood. This research proves fruitful and the gang is able to locate the vault with the guidance of Gershalt’s memory.</p>
						<p>Alas, the vault lies beneath what once was the garden of a Gershalt property and now is the wine cellar of none other than the new lord of Goldtown, Sigmund Finskoft. Should they pretend to be “special” workers again and hope for the best? They reject this idea. Should they barge in and trust their brute strength to gain them access to the wine cellar? Again, they reject this idea. Maybe they should just give it up as bad business and head their way to a new destination. Humphrey loves the thought of going home once more! Perhaps they should leave Goldtown behind and make stride toward Redstone to be introduced to the Puddlefoot family…</p>
						<p>As they bicker and begin to feel disheartened, Moro once again steps up and encourages them to not allow his wicked sister to remain at large. Who else will stop her, if we do not? Finally, they commit themselves to breaking into the Finskoft manor and unearthing the vault to uncover what treasures so many evil individuals are trying to get their hands on. But how? They yet again set themselves to plotting until they settle on a plan.</p>
						<p>Fannar and Autumn set themselves the task of purchasing the cheapest yet not the most disgusting wine and watering it down to a palatable taste. They then put on the best disguise they could muster and marched up to Finskoft’s front door. With Fannar holding the wine barrel and Autumn putting forth an amazingly convincing sales pitch, they manage to gain access to the wine cellar. They scope out the area and manage to make a good chunk of cash at the same time by persuading the wine taster that their wine was, in fact, extremely valuable.</p> 
						<p>As evening falls, Fenla transforms into a flea and squeezes her way through the front door of the manor. The rest of the group stays hidden outside with the exception of Humphrey, who decided to hang back at the Gershalt manor because he is not the sneakiest fellow. Once she is confident that the parlor is secure, she turns back into a gnome and stands on her tippy toes to unlock the door and push it open ever so slightly. A guard appears to have noticed, so Fenla quickly transforms herself into a unicorn, as was the plan.</p>
						<p>With a shake of her glorious mane, Fenla attempts to woo the guards with her glamour and thereby provide a diversion long enough for her friends to slip through the gaping door. The diversion certainly does work, but not the way she intended. They sense trickery and try to capture the bizarre apparition that pranced its way out of the house they are guarding. Fenla, realizing that she will not be able to sway them, successfully canters her way off the lawn and out of the wealthy district where she transforms back into a gnome to sleep in a tavern for the night.</p>
						<p>Meanwhile, Fannar, Alea, Autumn, and Moro have managed to sneak their way into the wine cellar and have begun to dig. Autumn keeps watch as the other three dig as quietly as they can. After much toil, they hear a CLUNK and find some large pieces of stone. These stones eventually lead them to an opening and, at long last, the secret vault is a secret no more. They explore the vault and pocket a few pieces of red and white stone that say SKAPAREN (the name of a deity) as well as a mysterious and ominous dark dagger.</p>
						<p>At this point, they all recognize that they have no exit plan! They did such a phenomenal job gaining access that they didn’t think about getting out! Panicking, they decide they just have to make a stealthy break for it. They hear Finskoft’s men discussing the unicorn, but they are able to sneak their way into the kitchen unnoticed. Autumn puts the cook to sleep and they scurry their way through the kitchen and out the back door. The four hope to make it to the hedge separating Finskoft’s and Gershalt’s properties unseen, but they are not so fortunate.</p>
						<p>One of the guards notices and begins to run at them shouting loudly about the intruders. Fannar casts a deep fog as they make a break for it and do their best to jump the giant hedge. Alea and Autumn clear it without a problem, but both Fannar and Moro make fantastic leaps only to find themselves scrambling back to the ground of Finskoft territory. Alea, as she is often wont to do, pulls forth her mighty bow and lets loose an arrow through the fog. After a moment the gang hears a grunt and a thud as the guard falls to the ground, clearly dead. Fannar and Moro then manage to climb their way over the hedge to freedom.</p>
						<p>Winded but pleased, they enter the Gershalt manor and share their findings with Gershalt, Humphrey, and Fenla (who had snuck her way back in the guise of a rat). The sun begins to rise on a new day as Gershalt informs them that he really doesn’t care about the vault’s mysteries, but he is fine with them laying low in his mansion until the storm of angry unicorn watchers fades. Apparently thievery is not uncommon, so they should be safe to depart within a few days. The adventurers agree and decide that they will leave Goldtown as soon as the coast is clear. Redstone may yet be on the horizon for our next adventure.</p>
