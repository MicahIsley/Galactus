The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.</p>
										<p>If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence(Investigation)check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.</p>

Each humanoid in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must make a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the following two effects.</p>
										<p>You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.</p>
										<p>Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell of if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the DM rules otherwise.</p>

										<p>For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn't speak any language, the creature is unaffected.</p>
										<p>You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature-what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning(if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind(such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.</p>
										<p>Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.</p>
										<p>You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can't see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can't detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn't speak any language.</p>
										<p>Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can't see it, but it must still be within range.</p>

										<p>You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger or smaller for the duration. Choose either a creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried.

Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.</p>
										<p>Enlarge. The target's size double in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category-from Medium to Large, for example.

									<h4>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</h4>
										<p>A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.</p>
										<p>When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
										<p>A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can't assume a different form until it leaves the spell's light.</p>
										<p>On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam 60 feet in any direction.</p>
										<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>

								<p>2nd-level illusion</p>
									<h4>Casting Time: 1 action</h4>
									<h4>Range: Touch</h4>
									<h4>Duration: 24 hours</h4>
										<p>You place an illusion on a creature or an object you touch so that divination spells reveal false information about it. The target can be a willing creature or an object that isn't being carried or worn by another creature.</p>
										<p>When you cast the spell, choose one or both of the following effects. The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this spell on the same creature or object every day for 30, placing the same effect on it each time, the illusion lasts until it is dispelled.</p>
										<p>False Aura. You change the way the target appears to spells and magical aura. You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear nonmagical, or change the object's magical aura so that it appears to belong to a specific school of magic that you choose. When you use this effet on an object, you can make the false magic apparent to any creature that handles the item.</p>
										<p>Mask. You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect creature types, such as a paladin's Divind Sense or the trigger of a symbol spell. You choose a creature type and other spells and magical effect treat the target as if it were a creature of that type or of that alignment.</p>

								<p>2nd-level abjuration</p>
									<h4>Casting Time: 1 action</h4>

									<h4>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour</h4>
										<p>A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you(including you)has a +10 bonus to Dexterity(Stealth)checks and can't be tracked except by magical means.

								<p>2nd-level illusion</p>
									<h4>Casting Time: 1 action</h4>
									<h4>Range: 60 feet</h4>
									<h4>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</h4>
										<p>You craft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you creatre a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.</p>
										<p>The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature.</p>
										<p>While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall-it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.</p>
										<p>An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm's reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if is is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.</p>
